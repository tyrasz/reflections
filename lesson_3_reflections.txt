When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I would like to keep a backup of my work
  When I would like to share my work easily with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When I am working on a feature and I might not want it to be destroyed by others working on the same code
	Having control over the code that I am working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks:cloning on github
	clone: copying a repository
	branches: independent line of development

	Using fork: to copy someone else's code when I don't have permission
	Clone: to pull or push code from github to and from local machine
	branch: to want to work on an independent line of development without affecting the master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Able to git diff with the local copy when there is no internet access
	Able to work without internet access at own pleasure / time
