When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I would like to keep a backup of my work
  When I would like to share my work easily with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	When I am working on a feature and I might not want it to be destroyed by others working on the same code
	Having control over the code that I am working on
