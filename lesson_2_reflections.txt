What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializes an empty git repository. Need to tell Git that you want it to be under git version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is different as it is an intermediate stage between working directory and repository. It offers a value in that it allows one to decide what files to commit to repository before actually committing it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can use the staging area to track which are the files that are changed per logical change and verify that it is indeed one commit per logical change.
